# Final Project P4
For all documentation related to your final project. You can use it for other purposes, but you do not have to.

For our project, we would like to use a blazor webapplication, that can be used to play connect four. Blazor is a C# based framework that can be used to create websites (which means no javascript!). This web application can be found on the following repository: https://github.com/exceptionnotfound/BlazorConnectFour.git.

We would like to build a pipeline for this project, in order to automatically build and test everytime a repo is pushed. These tests will include certain software quality metrics, and tests that check the logic used in the application.
